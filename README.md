## CGP++: Modern C++ Implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming

CGP++ is a modern C++ implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). CGP is a graph-based
representation model for genetic programming. CGP++ implementation focuses on the standard acyclic graph representation of CGP
and provides a generic framework that enables flexible usage. The main motivation and philosophy behind CGP++ 
is to facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the reproducibility of existing results. Based on object-oriented design,
CGP++ also provides a suitable framework that can be used to integrate new sophisticated methods that entail the implementation of complex architecture. 

### Key Features and Properties

- Generic design
- Checkpointing
- Concurrency support
- Mutation pipelining
- Crossover support
- Parameter interfaces for hyperparameter tuning 
- Benchmark utilities for symbolic regression and logic synthesis
  

### Requirements

Since CGP++ uses modern techniques of C++, it has to be compiled with a version of GCC that supports the C++17 standard. 

### Getting Started

#### Compilation 

We recommend compiling CGP++ using the G++ compiler with the following command: 
> g++ -std=c++17 -O3
