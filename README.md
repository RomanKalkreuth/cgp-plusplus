## CGP++: Modern C++ Implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming

CGP++ is a modern C++ implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). CGP is a graph-based
representation model for genetic programming. CGP++ implementation focuses on the standard acyclic graph representation of CGP
and provides a generic framework that enables flexible usage. The main motivation and philosophy behind CGP++ 
is to facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the reproducibility of existing results. Based on object-oriented design,
CGP++ also provides a suitable framework that can be used to integrate new sophisticated methods that entails the implementation of complex architecture.
