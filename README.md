## CGP++: Modern C++ Implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming

CGP++ is a modern C++ implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). CGP is a graph-based
representation model for genetic programming. CGP++ implementation focuses on the standard acyclic graph representation of CGP
and provides a generic framework that enables flexible usage. The main motivation and philosophy behind CGP++ 
is to facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the reproducibility of existing results. Based on object-oriented design,
CGP++ also provides a suitable framework that can be used to integrate new sophisticated methods that entails the implementation of complex architecture. 

### Key Feaures and Properties

- Generic design
- Checkpointing 
- Mutation piplining
- Crossover support
- Parameter interfaces for hyperparameter tuning 
- Benchmark utilties for symbilic regression and logic synthesis
  

### Requirements

Sicne CGP++ uses modern techniques of C++, it has to be compiled with a version of GCC that supports the C++17 standard. 

### Getting Started
