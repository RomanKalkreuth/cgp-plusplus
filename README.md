## CGP++: Modern C++ Implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming

CGP++ is a modern and versatile C++ implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). CGP++ provides a generic framework that enables flexible and versatile usage. 
The general motivation and philosophy behind CGP++ is to facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the reproducibility of existing results. 
CGP itself is a graph-based representation model for genetic programming, a search heuristic used for program synthesis. Based on object-oriented design, CGP++ provides 
a suitable framework that can be used to integrate new sophisticated methods that entail the implementation of complex architecture. 
CGP++ is not only intended to be a implementation of CGP but rather to serve as a blueprint for a modern and general genetic programming toolkit based on C++.


### Key Features and Properties

- Generic design
- Checkpointing
- Concurrency support
- Mutation pipelining
- Crossover support
- Parameter interfaces for hyperparameter tuning 
- Benchmarking utilities
  - Benchmark generator for symbolic regression
  - PLU reader for logic synthesis benchmarks
  
### Requirements

Since CGP++ uses modern techniques of C++, it has to be compiled with a version of GCC that supports the C++17 standard. 
> g++17

### Getting Started

#### Compilation 

We recommend compiling CGP++ using the G++ compiler with the following command: 
> g++ -std=c++17 -O3

#### Build 

For Linux, a classical Unix ```makefile``` is provided in the build folder. The command```make all``` can be used to create the executable.  

For building CGP++ on Windows, we recommend, using popular choices such as: 
- Mingw-w64 (https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
- MSVC (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
- VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) \\ 

On MacOS, the use of clang (https://clang.llvm.org/) in combination with VSCode can be considered as an alternative to using G++:

### Basic Usage

#### Configuration 

The compiled executable can be used with the parameter file in the ```data/parfile``` folder and the 
following commandline options. The data file, .plu file for logic synthesis and .dat file for symbolic regression, are
located in the ```data/``` folder. The data and parameter file are passed to CGP via commandline. Optionally, a checkpoint file
can be passed to CGP this way. The CGP and run specific options can be the passed to CGP via the commandline and parameterfile configuration.

#### Examples

##### Logic Synthesis
The following call to CGP++ triggers a run with a simple 1-Bit adder benchmark by using a 1+1 ES as search algorithm
and a simple CGP with 10 function nodes and point mutation:

```./cgp data/plufiles/add1c.plu data/parfiles/cgp.params -a 0 -b 10 -n 10 -v 1 -z 0 -o 1 -f 4 -r 2 -m 1 -l 1 -p 0.1 -c 0.0 -e 1000000 -j 10 -g 0```

Template settings: 
```
typedef int EVALUATION_TYPE;
typedef int GENOME_TYPE;
typedef int FITNESS_TYPE;
```

##### Symbolic Regression
This call triggers a run with the simple Koza1 benchmark (quartic polynomial) by using a 4+8 ES as search algorithm and discrete recombination:

```./cgp data/datfiles/koza1.dat data/parfiles/cgp.params  -a 1 -b 10 -n 10  -v 1 -z 0 -o 1 -f 4 -r 2 -m 4 -l 8 -p 0.1 -c 0.5 -e 10000000  -j 10  -g 0.01```

Template settings: 
```
typedef float EVALUATION_TYPE;
typedef int GENOME_TYPE;
typedef float FITNESS_TYPE;
```

#### Template Settings 

Template types can be set in the ```template/templates_types.h``` file.  

### Tutorial and Publication

A corresponding paper that describes CGP++ in more detail is currently under review. The CGP++ team also works tirelessly
on a tutorial which will be released soon. 

### Exemplary Program Output
